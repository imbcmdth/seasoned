# This file is a very simple format where the first column is name
# of the OUTPUT column in the CSV and the second column is the source
# of data for that column.

# These are columns recording general info about the salt file
File Name:  'fileName'  # Just the file name. If you want the whole path to the file, use 'absoluteFileName' instead
Row Number: 'rowNumber' # Is the row of number of the utterance in the file
Raw Line:   'rawLine'   # Has the text of a single line in the salt file

# These next columns are derived from the file name if parts of the file
# name are  seperated by underscores. In other words, given a file
# name of "jon_rivera_123_456_789.slt" then:
#  fileNamePart_0 = jon
#  fileNamePart_1 = rivera
#  fileNamePart_2 = 123
#  fileNamePart_3 = 456
#  fileNamePart_4 = 789
